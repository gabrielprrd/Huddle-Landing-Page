# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Thank you for checking this project! I'm excited to learn new things so feel free to commit and/or reach me out.

## Need help!
For some reason the mobile browser option on the chrome developer tools can't recognize the body as "overflow-y: hidden." I've already tried to create a wrapper div and use the command inside the wrapper instead of the body, but it also doesn't work.

## Frontend Mentor
The Huddle Landing Page is a challenge from https://www.frontendmentor.io so beginner developers can practice their skills.

## Worflow
The project is small for sure, but the main goal is to practice my workflow and pay attention to performance and support to most browser. I'm using Sass to make the stylesheets more readable, modular and trying to DRY (don't repeat yourself).

Also I'm using Gulp for some simple tasks like autoprefixing css, minifying images etc (check the package.json or gulpfile.js to see the small list).

For the "slide in" as the user scrolls down, I'm using a simple javascript library called Hello ScrollOut, which is very simple way faster than code it from scratch.

## Next steps
- "Thank you" message when user subscribes
- Fix the mobile overflow issue

I hope you liked it!
